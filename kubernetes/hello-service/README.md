# Hello Service

This is the "Hello Service" example from the [Quick Start guide](https://koreo.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start#hello-service).
This example demonstrates a Workflow that watches for Kubernetes Deployments
with a specific `service` label and, if present, creates a corresponding
Service for the Deployment.
