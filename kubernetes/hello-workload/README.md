# Hello Workload

This is the "Hello Workload" example from the [Quick Start guide](https://koreo.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start#hello-workload).
This example demonstrates building a simple workload abstraction that
encapsulates a Kubernetes Deployment and Service which is exposed through a
Workload CRD.
